# Smart-Parking-System

<p>The Smart Parking System is an <b>IoT-based</b> solution that helps solve the limited parking space problem in urban areas. Using an Arduino Uno board, two servo motors as barriers, and four IR sensors to detect the presence of vehicles, the system allows registered users to enter and exit the parking area easily. Once registered, users can save time and fuel by avoiding the need to circle the parking lot looking for a space. The system detects the vehicle's entry and exit, which inform the board to open or close the barriers accordingly. The Smart Parking System is an innovative solution that reduces congestion on the roads and provides convenience for users.</p> <br><br>

<h2>Benefits of the <b>Smart Parking System</b></h2>

<ul>
  <li>Increased efficiency: The system helps to manage parking spaces more efficiently, saving time and money for both the drivers and parking lot owners.</li>
  <li>Reduced traffic congestion: By reducing the time drivers spend searching for parking, the system can help reduce traffic congestion in urban areas.</li>
  <li>Improved safety: The use of sensors and barriers improves safety in the parking lot by ensuring that vehicles are parked in designated areas and preventing unauthorized access.</li>
  <li>Reduced carbon footprint: By reducing the time spent driving around in search of parking, the system helps to reduce carbon emissions from vehicles.</li>
  <li>Cost-effective: The system is cost-effective for both parking lot owners and users, as it reduces the need for manual parking management and reduces the time spent looking for parking.</li>
</ul>
